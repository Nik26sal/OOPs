Encapsulation :: warpping up the implementation of dataMembers and stuff and method in the class 
Abstraction :: hiding unnecessary details and showing valuable information 
example :: car key act as a abstraction 
in the above example the user use the key tostart the car but it does not know that how the car start internally so the method of starting car are wrap and to use this method key is given 
it is just like a getter setter used in the java program
